4. Create vivid imagery and intricate descriptions that bring the scene to life.
5. Develop complex characters with deep motivations and internal conflicts.
6. Incorporate subtle worldbuilding details that hint at a larger, intricate universe.
7. Focus on a single, powerful scene rather than trying to cover a large span of time or events.
8. **Don't just say what happensâ€”show it through the characters' actions, thoughts, and dialogue.** (for eg. instead of saying "the character was angry", show the character's actions or thoughts that convey anger)

Your writing should be of the highest caliber, matching the depth and quality of novels like Dune or The Way of Kings. Take your time to craft each sentence carefully, building a rich and immersive experience for the reader."""
