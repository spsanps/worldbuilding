Originating from the working class on Mercury, Maya has risen to become a key figure in the struggle for equality and justice across the planets.</p>

                    <h2 id="background">Background</h2>
                    <p>Born in 2429 on Mercury's harsh solar farms, Maya experienced firsthand the brutal realities of the class divide that defines 25th-century society. Her early life was marked by:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Grueling labor in the solar energy collection facilities</li>
                        <li>Limited access to education and technology</li>
                        <li>Exposure to the propaganda and oppressive policies of the noble class</li>
                        <li>Witnessing the toll of resource scarcity on working-class communities</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Maya's recruitment into The Collective occurred after a tragic incident involving noble interference in Mercury's resource distribution, which resulted in the loss of her family.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Latent Psionic Powers:</strong> Not fully understood or controlled, these abilities occasionally manifest in moments of stress or danger.</li>

                        <li><strong>Challenges:</strong> Navigating unfamiliar noble etiquette, advanced technology, and the constant risk of exposure</li>
